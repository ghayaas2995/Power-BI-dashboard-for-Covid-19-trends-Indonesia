# Power-BI-dashboard-for-Covid-19-trends-Indonesia

The Covid 19 indonesia dataset containing 38 variables and 21760 observations was analyzed in PowerBI and some insights reported from the analysis are as following:

**Province wise insights:**

1.	Most number of covid cases occured in Jawa island, specifically in 4 provinces of jawa island which are Djakarta, Jawa barat, jawa tengah and jawa timur. These 4 provinces are also the ones which are highly populated. 
2.	Djakarta, which is also the capital of indonesia observed the highest number of covid cases in the entire country with a total of 864K in two years. On the other hand, Gorontalo province observed the least covid cases with a total of 11800 cases collectively in 2020 and 2021. 
3.	Papua province of papua island has the most active cases in the two years followed by jawa tengah, jawa barat and Djakarta province of the jawa island. 
4.	Jawa tengah province observed 30218 covid deaths in 2 years which is highest among all the pronvices followed by jawa timur with 29600 deaths. 
5.	Banten although being the 6th highest population, observed highest fatality rate of 13.13% 

**Recommendations to the policy makers at the Indonesia ministry of health:**

1.	The major takeaway for the government from the recent pandemic is to work towards the development of the healthcare system. Indonesia is world’s 4th most populated country and as per an article by “frontiers in public health”, Indonesia needed an additional 1500 doctors and 2500 nurses to manage the surge of covid 19 patients.
2.	The health activities of highly populated provinces must be closely monitored, as these areas are more susceptible to virus outbreaks. Especially now when monkey pox is also declared as a global health emergency by WHO 5 days ago.
3.	A study must also be carried out to determine the causes for the Banten province observing the highest fatality rate during the covid 19 pandemic
